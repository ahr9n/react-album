# Photo Album

A Photo Album app where I could view images using the Picsum.photos API

## Description

As a user, you can:
* View a wall of pictures from Picsum, laid out as what is usually called a masonry layout;
  * The aspect ratio of the images is preserved.
  * At the end of the wall, there is a Load More button that to click to show more pictures from Picsum.
  * No two pictures in the wall are the same file.
* Hover on a picture to make it bigger;
  * With an animation while becoming bigger or returning to its previous size.
* Click on a picture and have it shown on another page;
  * The other page is showing the picture and its author.
  * Clicking the browser's back button takes me back to the wall of pictures.
